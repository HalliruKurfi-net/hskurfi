        <h1> Always and forever </h1>
You are the sun that shines brightly throughout my day.<br>
You are the gravity that holds me down in every way.<br>
You are the moon that shimmers throughout my night.<br>
You are stars that glimmer oh so bright.<br>

You are the oxygen that keeps me alive.<br>
You are my heart that beats inside.<br>
You are the blood that flows through me.<br>
You are the only guy I can see.<br>
You have the voice of when a mockingbird sings.<br>
You are my everything.<br>

You are my one and only.<br>
You stop me from being so lonely.<br>
We plan our future as if we have a clue.<br>
I never want to lose you.<br>
I want you to be my husband, and I want to be your wife.<br>
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.<br>
